Developers Guide
================

Snakemake is configured around a series of rules which specify how to generate
a file/files from a set of input files.  These rules are defined in the
``Snakefile`` and in the files in the ``rules`` directory.  In general the
structure is that a series of rules are defined to run on some calibration data
generation a final ``par_{tier}.yaml`` file at the end which can be used by the
``tier``` rule to generate all the files in the tier.  For most rules there are
2 versions the basic version and the partition version where the first uses a
single run while the latter will group many runs together.  This grouping is
defined in the ``cal_grouping.yaml`` file in the `legend-datasets
<https://github.com/legend-exp/legend-datasets>`_ repository.

Each rule has specified its inputs and outputs along with how to generate which
can be a shell command or a call to a python function. These scripts are stored
in the ``scripts``` directory.  Additional parameters can also be defined.
Full details can be found at `snakemake
